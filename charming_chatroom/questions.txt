1) What is a socket?
An endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network. 
It lays bwteeen TCP/ IP network protocol and application layer and allows application to transimit data through TCP/ UDP

2) What is the difference between the domains AF_INET and AF_UNIX?
they re bith address family (domain) used in socket programming
AF_INET: 
* This address family is used for IP-based communication, specifically with the IPv4 protocol
* It allows for communication between different machines across a network
* IP addresses (IPv4) + port number -> 4 octes

AF_UNIX:
* This address family is used for communication between processes on the same machine using file as the socket endpoint
* local Inter-Process Communication (IPC) on UNIX system
* file system paths as its addressing schema


3) What is the difference between SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM?
SOCK_STREAM: using with TCP, reliable, connection-based, stream-based
SOCT_DGRAM: using with UDP, connectionless, no reliable, packet-based

4) Why is it important to clear all the values the addrinfo struct before using it in getaddrinfo?
* Undefined behavior prevention: if not zeroed out, it may contain random data due to the way memory allocation works in many system
* Default values: setting most fields to a default value. 

5) What are ai_family and ai_socktype?
* ai_family: This field specifies the desired address family for the returned addresses.
    * AF_UNSPECIFIC, AF_INET, AD_INET6, AF_UNIX
* ai_socktype: This field specifies the desired socket type
    * SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW

6) What does getaddrinfo do?
* socket or network application
* It is used to resolve and translate names (host/ domain) into a set of socket addresses
* Or to translate service names (http) into a service number (port num)


7) What does connect do?
* establish connection between a socket (client side) and a remote socket address (server side)
* TCP -> three-way handshake
* UDP -> connectionless -> doesn't establish a real connection but sets the default destination for subsequent 'send' and 'recv'
* blocking, if the connection cannot be established

8) What is setsockopt?
* provide a way to fine-tune socket characteristics, adjust performance parameters, or enable or disable specific socket features

9) What does bind do?
* associate a socket with a specific local IP address and port number

10) What does listen do?
* mark a socket as a passive socket, meaning it will be used to accept incoming connection requests rather than initiate connection
* not use with UDP -> UDP-based server just use 'bind' to associate their socket with a particular address and port and then immediately start receiving data without needing to accept connections

11) What does accept do?
* used by server to accpet an incoming client connection
